1. Re-structure code/fix netlify issue: Right now, the site is sort of deployed to netlify, but some of the responsive functionality is gone. Plus none of the images load, just a blurry thumbnail instead. When I check it out in Inspector, it displays an error that is far beyond my competency. I talked to a friend who suggested it has to do with the way I structured my content.

2. Fix product page formatting issues. (https://youtu.be/tvd5GpTQduw): A pretty annoying glitch when the site is on mobile. Its probably pretty simple CSS that is responsible here. 

3. Basic JS audio player vs. custom audio player: Clips play on click. Stop on click OR when a different clip is clicked. OR build a custom CSS audio player like this  (https://youtu.be/xCzeIP1JzmE).
